title,GC Subclustering - Identifying genes during primordial follicle activation - SC19235,,,,
subtitle,lovell-badger Lab - Emily Frost,,,,
abstract,"Experimental Approach Please include details such as the number of biological technical replicates Premature Ovarian Failure POF is an infertility condition affecting 1 of all women and is characterised by amenorrhea, infertility and hypo-estrogenism before the age of 40 The phenotype of POF is a premature loss of oocytes eggs in the ovary Within the embryonic ovary, primordial germ cells PGCs proliferate and enter meiosis, becoming oocytes These oocytes are surrounded by a layer of somatic cells, termed pre-granulosa cells The oocyte surrounded by a layer of pre-granulosa cells is termed a primordial follicle, and these follicles make up the ovarian reserve available to the female for her reproductive lifespan These primordial follicles remain arrested until activated for development to be ovulated Once activated, these follicles cannot be regenerated This highlights the need for a better understanding of egg development in the ovary, and specifically how eggs are selected for maturation Working on understanding primordial follicle activation has several limitations We don t currently have the genetic tools to specifically isolate the pre-granulosa cells from primordial follicles to understand the signals that are initiating follicle activation Bulk RNA-Sequencing experiments of whole ovaries masks the changes occurring in the early-stage follicles due to their size Understanding the genetic signals that stimulate oocytes to activate will allow us to further characterise the mechanisms controlling female fertility Similar studies using single-cell sequencing have not been completed at these time points T he EMBL single cell expression atlas currently does not contain any studies completed on mouse ovaries This dataset would add to the literature surrounding primordial follicle activation, and will build on the bulk RNA-Seq experiment that we have already conducted In our bulk RNA-Seq experiment, we compared WT and p27null samples at four time points, two of which E18 5 and PND8 overlap with the time points chosen in the study design for this single-cell project This allows us to use both the bulk and single-cell sequencing analyses to fully characterise the transcriptomic changes in multiple cell populations As our bulk sequencing experiment has already highlighted interesting changes such as in the W NT pathway during follicle activation, single cell would be a huge advantage to characterise the heterogeneity in the granulosa cell populations at the early post-natal timepoints For our bulk RNA-sequencing experiment, we dissociated the ovary into single-cell suspensions before extracting RNA We have data on our papain dissociation protocol that we achieve a single-cell suspension, and that viability is above 80 following dissociation The filters used for this protocol were also the filters recommended by the ASF for single-cell experiments, so our protocol is established for the time points chosen We also have the advantage that for the time points chosen, granulosa cells and oocytes are the predominant cell population, with very little contamination by stromal cells or vasculature Figure 1 Preliminary data generated by Stefan Boeing showing decreases in Wnt4 and Fzd1 when follicles are prematurely activated in the p27null ovary To examine what genes are changed in the pre-granulosa cell population, I would like to use ovaries from WT mice at four timepoints E18 5 is when pre-granulosa cells begin invading the germ cell nests to form primordial follicles At post-natal day PND 1, most oocytes are encapsulated by pre-granulosa cells and have formed primordial follicles At the PND4, a proportion of primordial follicles are undergoing follicle activation To complete the time course, PND8 ovaries would be collected, which contain both dormant primordial follicles, along with primary follicles which have committed cuboidal granulosa cells These time points also fit within a published single-cell dataset which included E16 5 and PND6 timepoints Dissecting cell lineage specification and sex fate determination in gonadal somatic cells using single-cell transcriptomics Stevant et al 2019 Figure 2 Schematic showing the stages of follicle formation and activation relative to the time points chosen for single-cell analysis",,,,
