abstract,"Glial cells of the vertebrate enteric nervous system ENS have diverse proposed functional properties, ranging from neural progenitors to support cells for neurons F our subtypes of ENS glial have been identified in mouse by morphological and spatial criter i a, however molecular identifiers have remained elusive A variety of projects are underway in the lab to molecularly characterize mouse glial cells, including bulk and single cell transcriptomics As part of parallel projects examining the development and function of the ENS in zebrafish, a project to characterize zebrafish ENS glial cells was undertaken Surprisingly, none of the established ENS glial cell markers are expressed in the developing or mature zebrafish ENS However, while the majority of the ENS lineage marked by the sox 10 cre nlm-Cherry fl transgenic are neurons, a proportion of these are non neuronal cells These non-neuronal cells are labelled by the her4 1GFP transgenic, a tool which also labels radial glial cells of the zebrafish central nervous system These findings suggest that this non-neuronal population may be glial cell-like T he orthologue of her4 in mouse is Hes5 Intriguingly, using a Hes5GFP transgenic, we have now shown that Hes5GFP cells comprise a subpopulation of mammalian ENS glial cells, constituting a first molecular hallmark of a mammalian ENS glial subtype This underscores the power of our parallel studies in different species We would like to characterize the zebrafish ENS more extensively, including this glial-like population Although we are unable to effectively dissociate the zebrafish gut smooth muscle layer s to isolate the her4 1GFP cells embedded within, we can readily isolate nuclei of the ENS lineage by virtue of the nuclear Cherry of the sox 10 cre nlm-Cherry fl transgenic This resource provides a tool to generate a transcriptomic profile of the zebrafish ENS S ingle nuclei transcriptomics will enable us to establish clear profiles of distinct neuronal and glial-like populations Comparisons of transcriptomic data from zebrafish with analogous mouse data generated by our lab will benefit the future studies in both species Experimental Approach Please include details such as the number of biological and or technical replicates Nuclei from the enteric nervous system ENS lineage can be isolated from adult zebrafish gut tissues by virtue of lineage-specific nuclear fluorescent reporter expression sox 10 cre nlm-Cherry fl and FACS isolation as performed for our bulk analysis We plan to isolate 10, 000 nuclei to load the 10x QC of nuclei can take advantage of the fact that isolated nuclei are DAPI and cherry, and thus visible by fluorescence microscopy This experiment is a follow up on our previous bulk nuclei isolation The single nuclei strategy will enable characterization of the heterogeneous lineage labelled by sox 10 cre nlm-Cherry fl and delineation of the distinct p rofiles of neurons and glial-like cells, and subtypes therein We hope to compare mRNA expression analysis across bulk nuclei and single nuclei mRNAseq data sets, but also to compare to equivalent populations that our lab has profiled in the mouse bulk and single cell mRNAseq full genotype Tg-4725sox 10 cre _ba74 ßactin loxp-stop-loxp-nlmCherry Who wil l perform Bioinformatics Analyses If you are not using a member of the core Bioinformatics team at Crick, please provide some details of how you will perform the analyses We hope to have bioinformatics analysis performed by the relevant member s of the core Bioinformatics team We would like to perform bioinformatics analysis across our zebrafish data sets bulk and single mRNAseq, but also to compare to equivalent populations that our lab has profiled in the mouse both bulk and single cell mRNAseq Indicative Costing ASF Use Parameter Value Instrument Chromium-10X Experiment type 10X-3-RNA-Seq Experiment kit 10X_3prime_mRNA Total number of cells to capture 4000 Number of cells to input given capture rate 5600 Number of Channels 1 Sequencer HiSeq4000 Read type PE100 Reads per cell 100000 Total Reads 400000000 Number of HiSeq lanes MiSeq flowcells 1 Chromium-10X cost 1100 00 HiSeq4000 cost 1500 00 Staff and overheads cost 520 00 Total cost 3120 00",,,
